# Midterm

This project uses a .env file and requires a few Python extensions for using the .env file. When we were designing the functionality of the Pi we did not have dotenv downloaded which we accomplished through the following command.
``` shell
pip install python-dotenv
```
I unfortunately can't remember if we had to install anything else for our Pi to work. If any problems arise, please contact me at ebrady@iastate.edu and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
